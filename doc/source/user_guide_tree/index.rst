A tutorial is available as an `IPython notebook <ipython.org/notebook.html>`_. To see and run it you have to `download it here <../_static/tutorial/capsul_tutorial.ipynb>`_.

To run it, the following must be done:

* run the ipython notebook server, with Qt GUI support:

    ::

        ipython notebook --gui=qt

  A web browser should open with the ipython server running.

  You should see it in the list

* upload the notebook from the web browser, and start it

Here you are.
